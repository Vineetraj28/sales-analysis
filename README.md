# sales-analysis
A time series analysis of given data set in jupyter notebook done in pandas.


Time-series analysis is a method of analyzing a collection of data points over a period of time. Instead of recording data points intermittently or randomly, time series analysts record data points at consistent intervals over a set period of time.

While time-series data is information gathered over time, various types of information describe how and when that information was gathered. For example:

    Time series data: It is a collection of observations on the values that a variable takes at various points in time.
    Cross-sectional data: Data from one or more variables that were collected simultaneously.
    Pooled data: It is a combination of cross-sectional and time-series data.
